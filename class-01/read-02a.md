its look like the markdown is a new and not traditional way to use syntax and its an easy way and its used to text on the web the same features of vs any other 

iv noticed that i can use # instead h1 and ## instead h2
and ** like this will be bold**
*italic*
so we can use non alphabetic characters 
*GitHub use markdown which provide a good features

actually i am surprised from the features that gethub support so i need to read more about it

from the video i knew that you can reach to all the world and work with a team in very easy way and build your website without knowin html
in gethub i can make documentation and testing and the project with the same priority of your project 
things i want to read more about it in gethub :1.pagination 2.data collections 3. custom domains 4.output helper 

i noticed that its make the things easier just like painting not coding all what i need to get back to this source to help me:
