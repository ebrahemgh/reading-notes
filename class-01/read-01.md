there is more than one text editor and you can use any of it its like what did you like to choose ,and its to important if you want to make a website or somthing like this 
"the most important features are: 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax
highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them"(qouted)

the computers have like a defoult text editer for windows it notpad.
notepad++ is only for windows users and have have some good features but i dont like it 

text wrangler for mac users only so i am not very intrested of it 
BB edit is not for free 

visual studio is by microsoft and can be used on windows and linux and mac whith many features

atom is free also and can be used on all of theese enviroments 

brackets is free also made by adobe and have the fuituer â€œLive Preview"


so there is a text editor and there is ide (Integrated Development Environment)

 

the command line is an amzaing place to make some commands to your pc like create a directory or file and open it and close it and more .
"You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text."(qouted)
"there must be a space between the command and the first command line argument"(qouted)
. the most common shell is the bash
the paragraph talk about some intoduction and tell us how to open the terminal 
and what i noticed that the terminal will make every thing esier and will avoid you to make a silly mistakes 


basic navigation 
they are learning us the basics of how we are moving bitween the folders and directorys and using some commands such like pwd which will give you where are you located right now and there is the ls command that will show the interface but without the hidden folders .
important commands :
"file
obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
ls -a
List the contents of a directory, including hidden files." (qouted)


there is a paths and related paths and there is a small diffrence between them

there is the cd command wich will change the directory 

in the last reading file ( more about files)
i have got that linux is an extensionless and the linux assume that every thing is a file for it even the directories ,and linux is a case sensitive so i should be careful while i am typing or while i am using it
